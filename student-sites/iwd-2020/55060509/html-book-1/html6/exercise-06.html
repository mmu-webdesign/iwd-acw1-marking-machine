<h1>External Links</h1>


<p>Links are a vital part of every html document. For example a link to the BBC Sports website, may be useful for sports fans wanting to check the latest sports news.</p>


<p>A link direct to a certain part of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">BBC Sports</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/formula1">Formula One</a> page or the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/gossip">Football Gossip</a> is also possible if we have the full address (URL).</p>


<p>The text you use for the link is very important. If you took away the text surrounding links above, would the link text make sense on its own?</p>


<p>You should read more about writing good link text at the WebAIM article <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text">Link Text and Appearance</a>.</p>
