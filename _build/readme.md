## Marking app

To use this application:

1. Add a .csv of student names and IDs in the `student-list` folder, student name first.
2. Update the `config.php` file. Change the array of `$pages` and the `$check_url` base web address as required.
3. Go to the `index.php` file in a browser and click each name for a report on the web pages at `$check_url` (incorporating the `student ID`) `/$pages`.

Any problems please contact [Derren](d.j.wilson@mmu.ac.uk).
